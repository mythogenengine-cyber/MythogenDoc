Don't Use Racing Specs for Daily Commuting: The Cost-Benefit Myth in IT and AI Development
In today's technology landscape, the expertise of both IT specialists and automation engineers is worthy of recognition. However, the many strict standards, systematic setups, and complex processes they establish, while raising the bar, also often lead to a sharp increase in development and maintenance costs. We can't help but ask: is such a high cost really necessary?

The answer to this question depends on the situation.

Core Analogy: Is Your Need a Race Car, a Taxi, or a Family Car?
We can analyze this problem through an example that most people can understandâ€”the automobile.

Race Cars and Large Buses: The Ultimate in Enterprise-Level Demand
The systems of large enterprises are like race cars on a track or buses responsible for public transportation. They need to be kept in optimal condition day and night and are driven by different "drivers" (operators). Therefore, their demand for maintenance is extremely high. For example, the tread depth of a racing tire may need to be replaced when it wears down to 6mm, far higher than the legal mandatory replacement standard of 1.5mm, because any slight wear and tear can affect safety and performance under extreme conditions. This is the price that must be paid for the highest quality and safety.

Taxis: The Pragmatic Considerations of Professional Operation
The needs of professional drivers, such as taxi drivers, fall between those of a race car driver and an ordinary person. The car is their tool for "making a living," so it must be "used to the fullest." They may replace their tires when the tread depth is down to 3mm, more frequently than the average person, but with more economic considerations than a race car driver. To "use it to the fullest" safely, the driver must have professional knowledge and always pay attention to the condition of the car, such as checking tire pressure, spark plugs, etc., and proactively managing risks.

Private Cars: The Realistic Scenario of Daily Commuting
The needs of the vast majority of people are actually the same as those for a private car: "transportation." A new tire has a tread depth of about 8mm, and regulations require mandatory replacement at 1.5mm. For daily users, even if the tread wears down to 3mm or 4mm, it is still safe. If the original manufacturer or repair shop recommends that you replace the entire set of tires at this time, on the grounds of "keeping the vehicle in better condition," this may be a business strategy of "selling anxiety and fear." Experienced friends might remind you: "The tread is still deep enough, there's no need to rush to replace it, just pay more attention to it yourself."

This brings up a key point: many so-called "professional recommendations" are actually asking everyone to use "racing specs" to meet the needs of "daily commuting."

Applying the Analogy to Software Development and AI
This principle is especially applicable in the field of software development.

Many IT service providers or experts tend to apply the highest enterprise-level standards to all projects. But in fact, just as most people buy a car just for transportation, the vast majority of development needs, especially for initial minimum viable products (MVPs) or small internal tools, do not require such a large and complex architecture.

What I believe in is:

Learn to drive first, then pursue the limits: First, use existing tools like AI to quickly build a simple program that can solve the core problem. This is like learning basic driving skills.

Learn as you go, upgrade step by step: While implementing, simultaneously learn the basic theories of software development, such as design patterns, modularization, deployment strategies, etc. This is like a driver gradually becoming familiar with the vehicle's performance and maintenance knowledge while driving.

Don't be held hostage by tools, master the core logic: The tech world is changing too fast, tools are constantly being updated, and product cycles are getting shorter and shorter. Instead of delving into the details of every tool, it is better to strengthen your core logic of thinking, developing, and testing. Once you have mastered the basic principles of driving (such as steering and friction), you can quickly adapt whether you are driving a Toyota Corolla or a Subaru Impreza, rather than being trapped by a specific car model.

The Mindset Shift in the AI Era: When in a bind, change; when you change, you will find a way.
In the AI era, the barrier to entry for development has been greatly reduced. Many simple automation needs don't even require writing code; they can be executed by an AI agent through structured prompts. Technologies demonstrated by companies like Google can already automatically connect your documents and calendars to complete complex tasks.

If at this point, you still think that all AI applications must build a large IT team to handle enterprise-level security and deployment issues, then this kind of thinking will be eliminated by the trend. Because even within large enterprises, AI needs to be implemented flexibly. It is impossible to invest "racing-level" development costs for every small need of every employee.

This is like Han Xin commanding troops. The management of a million-strong army relies on a hierarchical and structured system (squad leaders, centurions, generals, marshals). The instructions passed down and the tasks undertaken at each level are different. It is impossible to require every soldier to have the strategic vision of a marshal.

Conclusion: In a racing team, only the race car drivers drive race cars.
Finally, let's return to the analogy of the race car. In a professional racing team, only the real race car drivers will drive the car that has been tuned to the extreme. The maintenance technicians, managers, and logistics personnel on the team ride in ordinary seven-seaters or minibuses in their daily lives. Even the race car driver himself drives his own private car after work.

This principle is very simple: matching the needs is the most efficient strategy.

Most development work is about solving the "commuting" problem, not challenging the F1 track. Using AI to build small tools and programs that can meet the needs is more than enough. Concentrate resources and efforts on "racing-level" projects that truly require extreme performance and safety, rather than making everything unnecessarily complex and expensive. Seeing your real needs clearly is the only way to avoid falling into the myth of "racing specs" and to move forward flexibly in the wave of technology.
