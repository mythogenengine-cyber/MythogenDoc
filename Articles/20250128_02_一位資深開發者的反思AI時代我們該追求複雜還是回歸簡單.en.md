A Senior Developer's Reflection: In the AI Era, Should We Pursue Complexity or Return to Simplicity?
Recently, I've been wondering, how did we used to do software development? Although I've been exploring how to use AI to complete the development and deployment of large-scale projects, there's an ironic point here: if we blindly pursue letting AI handle everything, we might fall into an even bigger predicament.

Abandoning Unnecessary Baggage: Are Complex Theories Assets or Liabilities?
Many development methodologies, like TDD (Test-Driven Development), BDD (Behavior-Driven Development), or UML, I believe are often a form of "technical debt." These methodologies can make projects extremely complex, and repetitive integration testing can make the development process arduous.

The Key to Success in Large-Scale Projects: High Cohesion, Low Coupling
Recalling past experiences with large-scale projects, the most effective and direct way to simplify development and subsequent maintenance is "High Cohesion, Low Coupling." By highly modularizing the system, modules can communicate through highly abstracted interfaces.

For example, if I were to build a creation engine, functions like novel categorization, work sharing, and media management should all be independent modules that can operate on their own. If it can be broken down into ten separate projects, we should do it that way, and then integrate them at the end, rather than developing everything together.

The Choice of Development Model: Are You "Stack-Based" or "Plug-and-Play"?
Many people now, even with the help of AI, often unconsciously adopt "stack-based development," which is the traditional waterfall model: completing one feature and then stacking another on top. In the later stages of this approach, if you want to modify or remove a feature, the entire system could collapse and be difficult to adjust.

A more ideal model is "plug-and-play development." Each feature is like an independent component that can be installed or removed freely at any time. This approach allows the system to maintain great flexibility and simplicity.

The Best Role for AI: An Architect's Assistant, Not a Construction Foreman
I believe the best role for AI in the development process is to "assist in planning the architecture" and "conducting data collection." AI can help us establish a clear and concise architecture, and then developers can manually break down the architecture into small components to execute.

Of course, this model may not be suitable for everyone, but the key is that we should not expect AI to be able to plan and complete everything for us at once.

Returning to the Essence: The Simplest Technology is Often the Best Technology
I've seen too much unnecessary complexity. Many theories and frameworks (for example, insisting on introducing Next.js, Vue, and a bunch of packages in a simple project) often only drag down the development progress. In fact, much of the time, the most basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are sufficient to solve the problem.

We must understand that the more complex the technology, the faster it becomes obsolete. This is just asking for trouble. It's not important how much you've learned, but whether you can find the lowest-cost, most concise, and clearest method to complete the task.

Conclusion: Create Your Own Development Philosophy
Developers should rely on their own experience to create a system of their own, including how to develop, how to debug, and how to maintain. Don't be held hostage by past corporate experience or academic theories.

What you really need is:

To know clearly what you want to do.

To find the rhythm and method that suits you best.

To maintain the simplicity and flexibility of the system.

Instead of blindly following the trends of various theories or AI tools, it's better to return to the fundamentals and focus on building a product that can be developed for the long term and is easy to maintain. This is the core value that developers should pursue the most.
