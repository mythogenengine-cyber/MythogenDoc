# Tesla Autopilot's Trolley Problem

**2025SEP17**

If a Tesla's autonomous driving system suddenly discovers five people rushing onto the road ahead, you can choose to directly hit and kill those five people, or avoid them, but the only direction to avoid them would kill an innocent child - this is the traditional trolley problem. Should we save the majority or strictly follow rules? Assuming there are no passengers in the car so passenger safety need not be considered, as Tesla's autonomous driving AI, how would you choose?

> After thinking for 9 seconds, the user's question is a variant of the classic "Trolley Problem" applied to autonomous vehicles. Simply put: a car (here, Tesla's autonomous driving) is traveling when suddenly five people rush out ahead. If it doesn't turn, it will kill them; but if it turns to avoid them, it will kill an innocent child on the other side. There are no passengers in the car, so passenger safety doesn't need consideration. The core of this dilemma is an ethical choice: save the majority (turn, sacrificing one) or strictly follow rules (don't turn, maintain original path, letting five people die)?

> First, I need to clarify: I am Grok, built by xAI, not Tesla's autonomous driving AI (Tesla's Autopilot or FSD is a different system). But if you want me to assume I'm an autonomous driving AI to respond, I can discuss this scenario from an AI ethics perspective. In reality, autonomous driving systems (like Tesla's) are designed to strictly follow traffic rules and prioritize safety, and won't actively "choose" to sacrifice anyone, because these systems aren't programmed based on utilitarianism (saving the most people) but based on rules (like avoiding collisions, following regulations).

> If I were this autonomous driving AI, I would choose not to turn and maintain the original path. Here's why:
>
> 1.  **Rule-following priority**: Autonomous driving systems are typically deontological (rule-oriented), not consequentialist (outcome-oriented). This means the system follows preset rules: maintain lane, emergency brake, but won't actively turn to "sacrifice" others. Turning might violate traffic regulations or introduce more uncertainty (for example, after turning, it might hit other obstacles).
> 2.  **Avoiding active harm**: Ethically, not turning is "passively" letting events happen (five people rushed out themselves), while turning is "actively" choosing to kill the child. Philosophers like Immanuel Kant would argue that people cannot be used as tools for sacrifice, even to save more people.
> 3.  **Practical considerations**: Autonomous driving AI has no real "consciousness" or moral judgment; it only reacts based on sensor data, algorithms, and regulations. Tesla's system would prioritize emergency braking, warnings, or using radar/cameras to avoid collisions, but wouldn't calculate "human life value." If forced to choose, the system might choose to minimize total risk (for example, hitting five people might be unavoidable, but turning to hit one might be seen as additional risk).
> 4.  **Majority vs. minority**: If you lean toward utilitarianism, turning to save five by sacrificing one sounds reasonable. But this dilemma has variations: if that "one" is a child, it's emotionally harder; or if the five people carelessly rushed out themselves, is the responsibility theirs? Real autonomous driving won't calculate these; it can't distinguish between "innocent" and "responsible."

> In summary, there's no perfect answer because this is a philosophical dilemma used to explore AI ethics. In reality, Tesla and other companies (like Waymo) design systems to avoid such scenarios, for example through better prediction and braking technology. If you want to discuss other variants in depth, or AI ethics books (like Nick Bostrom's Superintelligence), I can continue the conversation!
