I actually think GenAI is useful for more than just marketing; its real, greater potential lies in industry and scientific research. The difficulty, however, isn't the technology but the internal processes and cultural resistance.

Itâ€™s like when Intel tried to pivot. No matter how visionary the top executives were, they were bogged down by internal opposition. In contrast, AMD managed to restructure its business, create the Zen architecture, and eventually overtake Intel as a mainstay in data centers.

The supply chain and manufacturing are still the most lagging areas in big data application. Imagine this: R&D in Taiwan, production in Vietnam, materials from China, and shipping to Europe and the US. Just the document approvals, logistics transparency, and shipping schedules require a ton of manual work. AI can clearly integrate structured and unstructured data in real-time to make processes transparent and automated. But the reality is: industry experts don't know AI, and AI experts aren't familiar with the industry, making implementation naturally difficult.

There's another core issue: human nature. If employees feel that AI will take their jobs, resistance is inevitable. As a result, the ROI that should have increased is instead slowed down.

So, companies end up focusing their investments on marketing because it's easy to quantify and low-risk. But the truly high-potential areas are scientific research, supply chain, and automation. To succeed, it's not enough to just buy technology; you have to address internal processes, talent gaps, and cultural resistance all at once.

I once worked with a company that analyzed defects on a production line. On the surface, their data processes were complete, but in reality, it was more of a "performance": constantly running calculations to find factors, and then explaining that "the high defect rate is due to strict quality standards." The problem was, the market had already given the answerâ€”it didn't add up.

Later, an AI team came in and tried to use backpropagation to replace manual analysis. In theory, this was correct, but there were two fatal blind spots:

*   **Incomplete data** â†’ The model couldn't learn correctly.
*   **Unclear variable correlations** â†’ The model misinterpreted the data, leading to a completely wrong direction.

Here's a simple example: poster printing. Screen colors are light-based (additive), while print colors are reflective (subtractive). A color base conversion is needed in between. If you don't understand this process, even if an expert gives you the formula, they can still secretly manipulate it, turning "optimization" into "color distortion." This is just a simplified version; actual industrial scenarios are a hundred times more complex.

However, there are already success stories in Taiwan:

*   A production line increased its yield from 90% to 98% through AI ðŸ‘‰ ctci.org.tw
*   PCB manufacturing introduced AOI + AI, significantly improving automated inspection ðŸ‘‰ Allied Vision
*   The accuracy of metal crack detection was raised from 85% to 98% ðŸ‘‰ automan.tw
*   The prediction accuracy of wafer White Pixels reached 95.18%, with the key being the grind blade operation ðŸ‘‰ MDPI
*   A survey shows that 76.2% of Taiwanese manufacturing has already implemented at least one AI application ðŸ‘‰ manufacturingdigital.com

ðŸ‘‰ So, the real battlefield for AI isn't marketing; it's the production line. To win, you need more than just technology; you need a collective push from **people + processes + culture**.

GenAI isn't just for marketing. Its potential in scientific research, supply chain, and automation is even greater. But the biggest obstacle isn't the technology; it's **internal processes + cultural resistance**.

2/
Intel's transformation was stalled by internal forces; AMD, by restructuring its business, created the Zen architecture and eventually surpassed them.
â†’ The example is clear: having the technology â‰  successful implementation.

3/
The supply chain is still the most lagging in data application: R&D in Taiwan, production in Vietnam, materials from China, shipping to Europe/US. Just documents + logistics require manual work, which AI can clearly solve.

4/
But the problem is: industry experts don't know AI, and AI experts aren't familiar with the industry, so implementation gets stuck.

5/
Add to that human nature: employees fear AI will take their jobs â†’ resistance â†’ slows down ROI.

6/
I've seen companies with "fake automation," constantly explaining that a high defect rate is due to strict quality standards, but the market already said that doesn't fly. The same happens when AI comes in; if the **data is incomplete** and **variable correlations are unclear**, it won't work.

7/
A simple example: poster printing. Screen color is light-based, print color is reflective, and a color base conversion is needed. If you don't know the process, even with a formula, an expert can turn "optimization" into "color distortion."

8/
But there are success stories in Taiwan ðŸ‘‡

*   Yield 90â†’98% (CTCI)
*   PCB AOI+AI (Allied Vision)
*   Metal crack detection 85â†’98% (automan.tw)
*   Wafer prediction 95.18% (MDPI)
*   76.2% of Taiwanese manufacturing has adopted AI (manufacturingdigital)

9/
Conclusion: The real battlefield for AI is the production line. To win, it's not just about technology, but about **people + processes + culture**.

Should I help you add hashtags (#AI #Manufacturing #MadeInTaiwan #Automation) and a call-to-action (e.g., "What do you think is the biggest obstacle to AI implementation?") to drive engagement?
