### üöÄ From "Done in a Month" to "Stuck for Three Months"

I originally thought developing the Creation Engine would be simple:
Launch a simple website in one month and start publishing articles. An MVP could even be whipped up in two hours if I moved fast.

But the reality was:

- Finding a target audience isn't easy.
- The system was much more complex than I imagined.
- I quickly got lost in a self-imposed maze of "corporate management culture."

The corporate way of doing things: setting up GCP, Firebase, avoiding n8n, drawing architecture diagrams, writing PRDs and engineering documents, and even considering TDD, BDD, and long-term planning.

I feel that getting bogged down in these bloated, troublesome concepts and cultural self-constraints so early in development was unnecessary.

I could have built an MVP in two or three days, but instead, I tied my own hands, dragging it out indefinitely.

As a result, the ideas I wanted to test quickly were instead boxed in by so-called "professional processes."

### üõ†Ô∏è AI Collaboration: New Possibilities

In June 2025, I began experimenting with building my own team of AI agents. Back then, the Claude code sub-agent hadn't been released, so everything had to be designed from scratch. Initially, it seemed ideal: the agents helped me clarify requirements and generate initial documents, and at least the basic direction and framework were quite solid. But when it came to actual deployment, problems started popping up one after another.

Modular development sounds as simple as using plugins, but it's not that straightforward. Take Firebase, for example. I originally just wanted to build a membership authentication and database system. Using Firebase Studio AI was indeed fast; I just input the requirements, and it automatically generated the code and handled deployment. But when I tried to replicate this setup locally, or even rebuild it with Python + FastAPI, I discovered that the two were completely incompatible, and deployment was incredibly difficult. Firebase's "all-in-one" package is convenient, but once you try to decouple it for custom assembly, you get stuck. The documentation was scattered, and the AI was almost no help, making debugging a nightmare. This member system + database + RAG setup had me stuck for a whole month.

It wasn't until I switched to Supabase that things completely changed. The problem was immediately unlocked. Combined with n8n for automation and Python for the API, the complex conflicts disappeared. This experience made me reflect: solutions like Firebase and automated deployment aren't really designed for developers. They serve a corporate culture focused on "security" and "maintenance." They are products designed for large company workflows, not the best choice for an MVP or personal development. In contrast, lightweight, modular tools like Supabase and n8n are the real "mainstream" that can truly help developers.

At this point, I realized I had been led astray by a lot of "professional advice." Online, you often see people talking about VIBE CODING and CONTENT ENG DEV, making it sound like you need to have requirement documents, test documents, and security documents all in place to be considered professional. But in practice, this often results in a pile of spaghetti code with complex inheritance and chaotic coupling that's impossible to untangle. Old systems often lack documentation, so what does "maintaining old systems well" even mean? Honestly, it's just nonsense.

What's even more ridiculous is the crowd of so-called professionals who constantly emphasize grinding LeetCode, as if you can't code without it. But when I used to write C and C++, I never grinded problems and still completed projects. Writing code isn't about memorizing problems; the most important thing is architectural thinking‚Äîhow to reasonably break down and assemble a system to make it flexible and maintainable.

That's why you now see that some of the people who are best at using AI to code aren't the engineers who sit and write code day and night, but rather PMs or traditional senior software architects. They don't focus on a single piece of code; they know how to use AI to quickly connect modules, build the architecture, and let the system grow organically. As for those still stuck in the role of "writing and maintaining code," their value is slowly being diluted.

To sum up this experience, I think the biggest lesson I learned is: **Tools don't have to follow the "professional" path of big companies. The real mainstream is the most flexible, plugin-based, and fastest-to-implement tools.** Firebase and local deployment represent an old enterprise logic; Supabase and n8n are the language of the new era of development. The most valuable skill in the future won't be how many lines of code you write, but how you master AI, assemble modules, and design architecture.

Diligently grinding problems and maintaining spaghetti code are no longer core skills; knowing how to integrate resources and fail fast is the true mark of a professional.

### üë• Employment vs. Partnership

In the traditional employment system, employers often have to bear various risks and responsibilities for their employees: health, emergencies, emotional management, learning costs... This is a heavy burden for small and medium-sized enterprises, and even one-person companies.

I believe the most important thing is **clarity and transparency, not emotional blackmail**.
For example, if I order a handmade model and you promise to finish it in two weeks, I can accept that. But if you find you need an extension midway, as long as you tell me clearly, I can choose to wait patiently or pay extra to find someone else to help. It's a reasonable logic of cooperation for me to bear these risks myself. But playing the victim by saying, "I'm miserable, I have to support so many people, so I need to raise the price, delay, or even break the contract," is a departure from the spirit of cooperation. If the employment relationship is built on exploitation and then relies on labor laws for protection, or if a company uses benefits as a selling point, but the supervisors and colleagues voluntarily give up those benefits, self-enslave, and even engage in infighting.

In contrast, a restaurant's model is much clearer: you order a dish, and if it's not good, you can choose not to eat it, but you won't be asked to pay more or wait longer because the chef is in a bad mood. This isn't heartless; it's the reality of small-scale operations. For a one-person company or a small company with limited resources, it's almost impossible to meet all the life needs of employees simultaneously. It's not that they don't want to care, but that they lack the ability.

I once had an ideal: if I ever started my own company, I would ensure my employees didn't have to worry about their livelihood. But the reality is that the industry is fiercely competitive, and without sufficient profit, ideals alone can't sustain a business. I saw it when I worked at a foreign company: reasonable benefits are built on reasonable profits. If an industry has low gross margins and high risks, providing stable security is an almost unsolvable problem.

Therefore, the relationship between employment and partnership needs to be re-examined. When I was a student, freelancing was simple: I negotiated the requirements, completed the work myself, and delivered the results. But once you have employees, the complexity skyrockets: emotions, holidays, accidents‚Äîall of it falls on the boss.

And the emergence of AI has completely changed this model.
**Most requirements can already be solved by AI; the rest can be outsourced.**
It's like cooking: you can cook yourself, order takeout, or buy pre-made meals, but you don't necessarily need to employ a full-time chef.

In this new model, cooperation is closer to an "equal contract" rather than traditional employment.
I state the requirements, you deliver the results, the price is transparent, and if you can't deliver, I find someone else. It's simple and direct, no longer requiring the management of emotional and interpersonal issues like "leave requests and vacations."

For small-scale operators of the future, this combination of AI + outsourcing + a one-person company might be the only truly sustainable logic for survival.

### üß† **The Creator's Dilemma in Workplace Culture: When a Hobby is Seen as "Not Doing Your Job"**

Since October 2023, I've been writing a blog on and off for nearly a year, publishing a total of only 46 articles. Compared to some content creators online who can publish over forty articles a month without AI assistance, my number is certainly small. But for me, writing wasn't a side hustle at the time, just a simple hobby. I spent two hours, or even just half an hour, each week maintaining the habit of writing.

The problem is, in certain company cultures or circles, even if I spend so little time writing, people will still think, "You must have a lot of free time," or "Are you not busy?" It can even lead to gossip and attacks. Compared to others who talk about playing basketball, swimming, or building models, writing is also a personal hobby. But because it remains online, on a public platform, it becomes a "death by exposure" activity, easily magnified and used as a pretext for attacks.

In reality, most full-time jobs don't encourage employees to develop side hustles. Even if I'm not doing it for money, just writing articles, there's still pressure to keep it "out of sight." You can do it secretly on the surface, but if you're serious about creating content or media, you will inevitably leave a record: articles, videos, social media accounts‚Äîthere will always be traces. Using a pseudonym or borrowing someone's name to hide it will only backfire in the end.

So, my real pressure points are several:

**The Constraints of a Full-Time Identity** ‚Äî Many companies don't allow employees to have side hustles, making my creative work feel "illegal" and something I can't do openly.

**Pressure from a Toxic Culture** ‚Äî In an environment where "working until you're depressed is considered diligent," taking a little time to do something you enjoy easily makes you a target for attacks.

**Creation Requires Long-Term Accumulation** ‚Äî Whether it's a novel, a game, or a series of feature articles, it's not something that can be finished in a few months. If you're forced to stop midway because of your job, picking it up again becomes doubly difficult.

**The Conflict Between Being Public and Hidden** ‚Äî I want a legitimate space to create, but reality may force me to hide. This conflict consumes a lot of mental energy and can even shake my determination to continue creating.

On the surface, everyone will say their hobbies are hiking, fishing, traveling, and eating.
But in private, it's a different story:
üëâ **A Culture of Misery Olympics**: Whoever works the hardest and has the least time appears the most dedicated.
üëâ **Mutual Attacks**: The thinking is, "You still have the leisure to write articles/pursue a hobby, so you must not be working hard enough."
üëâ **Replying to emails while hiking, having meetings while traveling, and joining Zoom calls during dinner.**

So the question is: are people really that busy, or have they just gotten used to using "busyness" to prove their worth?

In fact, true freedom isn't about how many trips you've taken, but **whether you can no longer be held hostage by this culture.**

For me, the biggest difficulty in creation isn't inspiration or skill, but how to maintain continuity amidst real-world pressures and the environment of. If it's interrupted midway, whether it's a blog, a novel, or even a game project, it might remain forever half-finished, losing the possibility of completion.

### üç≥ **Building a Product is Like the Art of Dining: In the Wave of Technology, Should We Cling to "Hand-Drawing" or Embrace "AI"?**

As a developer, I often feel that the process of building a product is surprisingly similar to "eating," something we face every day.

When it comes to eating, the choices are endless. You can go to a high-end restaurant or a five-star hotel to enjoy exquisite service and cuisine; you can go to the market, buy groceries, and cook a homemade meal yourself; and of course, you can also order delivery or even buy a ready-to-eat meal to get by.

Every choice can fill your stomach, and there's no absolute right or wrong. Market demand and public acceptance are influenced by various factors like the economic environment, rent, and ingredient costs. The real key is to **"adapt to the times"**‚Äîto see clearly what cards you hold and what the market needs at the moment.

#### **The Myth of Tech Tools: Do You Have to Use React or Next.js to be "Professional"?**

This principle makes perfect sense in the world of software development.

You often hear voices saying: "You're still using Video coding? That's not the proper way!" or "Knowing only HTML + CSS + JS is too basic," as if you must use front-end frameworks like Next.js, Vue, or React to be called a "professional developer."

This kind of criticism reminds me of the century-long evolution of the animation industry; history is surprisingly repetitive:

1.  **The Hand-Drawn Era:** When computer graphics (digital art) first appeared, many veterans criticized it for "lacking soul," insisting that the strokes and warmth of hand-drawing were king.

2.  **The Popularization of Digital Art:** However, with its advantages of high consistency, high efficiency, and low cost, digital art eventually made the animation industry mainstream, significantly boosting both production volume and quality.

3.  **3D and Computer Rendering:** Next, 3D technology and more powerful rendering tools made animation production faster and more refined, pushing the entire industry to a wider audience.

4.  **The Present of AI Art:** Now, it's AI art's turn to take the stage. As expected, a chorus of opposition has risen, but the outline of the trend is just as clear.

#### **The Value and Limitations of "Hand-Drawing": When the Market Accepts a New Aesthetic**

The value of hand-drawing lies in its uniqueness, just like everyone's handwriting, which can never be perfectly replicated. This uniqueness will certainly continue to exist, but its market capacity is relatively limited, often moving towards the realm of high-end art or collectibles.

However, when our goal is to "popularize animation" or "more effectively express emotions and stories," the market has already proven with its actions that it accepts AI art. If so-called "experts" are still stuck on criticisms like "you should go back and master hand-drawing, sculpture, and aesthetic theory first," they are actually missing the point.

Why?

üëâ **Because the market has already accepted the aesthetic created by AI art.**

üëâ **For the end-user, what software or framework you used to create your work is completely irrelevant.**

#### **The Real Core: Do You Know How to "Express"?**

Different creative methods correspond to different market segments:

-   **Hand-Drawn Art:** There will always be people who will pay for it, making it a top-tier art form.

-   **Digital Art:** In many professional fields, it remains an indispensable core skill.

-   **AI Art:** The market will expand rapidly because it can meet the widest range of needs at the lowest cost.

So, what's truly important has never been how many tools you can use, but rather:

1.  **Do you possess an artistic sense and appreciation?**

2.  **Can you master AI as a tool to express your creativity and make it resonate with the market?**

Interestingly, traditional hand-drawn and digital artists actually have a unique advantage in this AI wave. Because they know better than anyone how to "describe" a good piece of work and how to "guide" the AI to make the generated results closer to a human touch and their own unique style.

The "Prompt Engineering" we are so fervently discussing now‚Äîisn't its underlying skill based on your deep understanding of artistic principles, light and shadow, composition, and aesthetics?

**Ultimately, a tool is always just a tool. The point isn't whether you use a paintbrush or a keyboard, but the ideas in your mind and the artistic expression in your heart.** In the flood of technology, instead of anxiously chasing the next hot framework, it's better to return to the fundamentals and hone your ability to identify problems, define beauty, and create value.

### üå± Summary: Let Go of the Baggage and Become an Architect Who Masters Tools

From initially getting bogged down in enterprise-level development workflows to later finding liberation with lightweight tools like Supabase and n8n; from reflecting on traditional employment relationships to resisting a workplace culture where "busyness is a virtue." The core of this journey has been a redefinition of "professionalism."

In the past, we were taught that "professional" meant following big companies' SOPs, using the hottest frameworks, writing perfect technical documents, and even not daring to have our own creative projects outside of work for fear of being labeled as "not focusing on our proper job."

However, this period of being stuck and breaking through has made me deeply realize:

1.  **True professionalism is "adapting to the times," not rigidly sticking to rules.** For individual developers or startup teams, the most crucial thing is to validate ideas quickly. Instead of being held hostage by "all-in-one" packages like Firebase, which are designed for corporate security and maintenance culture, it's better to embrace flexible, modular tools like Supabase and n8n. They are the mainstream of development in this era.

2.  **In the AI era, value lies in "architectural thinking," not "toiling away."** Just as PMs or software architects are better at harnessing AI than front-line engineers, the core competitiveness of the future is no longer about grinding LeetCode or maintaining chaotic old code, but about knowing how to break down problems, combine modules, and leverage AI to quickly build viable systems.

3.  **The work model is shifting towards "partnerships," not "employment."** The popularization of AI allows us to solve a large number of needs at a lower cost, with the rest being completed through outsourcing and equal collaborations. This enables "one-person companies" or small teams to escape the heavy burden of the traditional employment system and return to a pure relationship focused on value delivery.

Ultimately, whether it's the choice of development tools, the transformation of work models, or the pursuit of personal creation, we all need to break free from the toxic culture of "misery olympics" and "infighting." True freedom isn't about how many trips you've taken, but about **having the power to choose without being held hostage**‚Äîchoosing the most suitable tools for the current goal, choosing the most efficient collaboration methods, and preserving a space where your interests and creations can exist openly and legitimately.

By letting go of our obsession with "standard answers," we can become architects who truly master our tools, rather than craftsmen enslaved by them.
