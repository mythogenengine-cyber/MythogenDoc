# [Location/Vehicle Profile]: The Sky Ship Aria

*2025nov18*

## 1. Identity & Origin

-   **Full Name:** Strategic Cruiser City - Aria
-   **Common Name:** The Sky Ship
-   **Design Prototype:** An aerial-enhanced version of the ancient industrial ruin "Hashima Island (Gunkanjima)."
-   **Home Universe:** Universe 15 (Mythogen World/Amerion)
    > **Note:** Although located in Universe 25 (Reality), its essence is the materialized projection of high-dimensional technology from another world.
-   **Owner:** Sun / The Triumvirate of the other world.
-   **Legal Status:** Extraterritorial territory in the high seas/skies
    -   Nominally under the jurisdiction of "Baiyue Commercial Port," it is not subject to any national sovereignty.
    -   Regarded as a "Necessary Evil" by global governments, providing cheap undocumented labor, money laundering services, and gray-market transactions.

## 2. Technical Specifications

-   **Hull Dimensions:** Length approx. 720m / Width approx. 240m / Vertical height approx. 200m (estimated).
-   **Power Core:** Arc Fusion Reactor
    -   **Source:** Universe 15 technology.
    -   **Features:** Simulates the cold fusion energy of a miniature star, emitting a ghostly blue light (as seen in the thrusters), capable of sustaining the ship's indefinite suspension and navigation.
-   **Hull Material:** Adamant-15
    -   A special, active memory metal with self-repair capabilities, nearly indestructible under the physical laws of Universe 25.

## 3. Districts & Facilities

### [Upper Decks: The Visible Topside]

-   **District A: Palace Gardens**
    -   **Location:** Bow and upper central deck.
    -   **Environment:** Features the ship's only natural sunlight, triple-filtered air, and genetically modified evergreen gardens.
    -   **Facilities:** Low-density luxury villas, private helipads, and palaces for otherworldly envoys.
-   **District B: Skyport Command**
    -   **Location:** Stern and side decks.
    -   **Facilities:** Military runways, defensive turret arrays, cargo handling ports.

### [Mid-Levels: The Buffer Zone]

-   **District C: The Neon Den**
    -   **Location:** Below the bridge, a hub connecting the upper and lower decks.
    -   **Function:** Entertainment, gambling, intelligence exchange.
    -   **Core Facility:** "The Helios Summit"
        -   **Original Name:** Gao's Casino (renamed)
        -   **Style:** The name sounds like a high-end real estate project, with an interior of extreme luxury, themed around the sun god mythology.
        -   **Function:** The heart of the entire ship. On the surface, it's a top-tier den of pleasure; in reality, it's Sun's intelligence exchange center.
        -   **Activities:** Hosts "Black Market Auctions," trading otherworldly artifacts, high-tech weaponry, and rare natural ingredients.

### [Lower Decks: The Hidden Hull]

-   **District D: The Warrens**
    -   **Location:** Deep within the hull, surrounding the engine room and maintenance shafts, completely devoid of daylight.
    -   **Environment:** A high-density complex resembling the Kowloon Walled City. The air is thick with the smell of engine oil, sweat, and synthetic food. The temperature is extremely high (due to proximity to the reactor).
    -   **Facilities:** Stacked capsule homes (coffin houses), illegal clinics, underground drug factories, water recycling plants.
-   **District E: The Bastion**
    -   **Location:** The lowest armored section.
    -   **Facilities:** Armory, heavy vehicle maintenance bays (not open to the public).

## 4. Demographics

-   **Estimated Total Population:** Approx. 60,000 - 80,000
-   **Top Elite (5%):**
    -   **Composition:** Sun's core cadres, otherworldly envoys, reclusive tycoons from various nations, high-level officials from Baiyue Commercial Port.
    -   **Residence:** Palace Gardens.

    -   **Residence:** The Warrens.
-   **Spatial Extremity:** This 80% of the population is crammed into just 15% of the ship's effective living space.

## 5. Culture & Control

### A. The Gastronomic Divide

> This is a global method used by "The Control Matrix" to control human frequencies, and it is most extreme on Aria.

-   **Staple for the Poor: Synth-Paste**
    -   **Source:** The ship's internal recycling system. Organic waste (sewage, kitchen scraps, corpses) is broken down and reprinted through molecular recombination.
    -   **Ingredients:** Contains precisely calculated industrial flavorings, addictive agents, and mood suppressants.
    -   **Gustatory Enslavement:** The taste is engineered to be intensely salty and sweet. The poor have **"gotten used to it"** and consider it a delicacy. Their taste buds have degenerated, making them unable to appreciate natural food, which they might even find bland or disgusting.
    -   **Purpose:** To lock down their physical frequency, maintaining a low level of satisfaction and survival anxiety.
-   **Staple for the Rich: Natural Organics**
    -   **Source:** Natural plants and animals cultivated in top-level greenhouses or smuggled from the ground/other worlds.
    -   **Status:** A symbol of identity. The rich view synthetic food as "junk food" (like instant noodles), consumed only occasionally. True luxury is eating flawed, real life.

### B. Economic Ecology

-   **Shadow of the World's Factory:** Aria leverages its extra-legal status and cheap labor to become the world's largest processor of contraband (counterfeit drugs, military-grade chips).
-   **Baiyue Law:** Here, everything is legal as long as you can afford it.
