# Core Protagonists Explained: Sun, Moon, and Star

> 2025nov13

These three protagonists are the trinity of "The Creation Engine Project," inseparable and complementary. They represent the "Will," "Faith," and "Wisdom" necessary to start a revolution.

---

## 1. Gao Sheng — "The Sun"

### "The Captive Sun"

- **Role**: Will / Resource / Reality
- **Affiliation**: The People's Harmony
- **Identity**: Leader of the "Gao Clan," an underground gambling syndicate in the "Hundred-Yue Ports"; a "model corrupt official" for "The Harmony" (a disguise).
- **Philosophy**:
> The house always wins... but if the stakes are big enough, and "the odds aren't zero," it's worth flipping the house's table.

### Backstory: The "Young Master" in the House's Shadow

#### Prologue: "Probability" in the Ashes

Gao Sheng's childhood was spent in the last rays of a dying era, before the "Hundred-Yue Ports" were fully "harmonized." The Gao clan were once the underground kings of this subtropical coastline; their "rules" arrived long before the "Presidium's" laws.

His father, the old head of the Gao clan, was a charismatic "old-world rebel." He believed "will" could conquer all. When the "Ministry of Integration's" "Red Mist" fleet sailed into the harbor, he chose to resist—a gamble with zero chance of winning.

A young Gao Sheng watched it all from behind a one-way mirror on the second floor of the casino.

He watched his father's "passion" being mercilessly crushed by the Ministry's standard-issue armor. He watched the "uncles" who were his father's sworn brothers yesterday kneel, beg for mercy, and betray his father in exchange for "Harmonious Citizen" status.

In the end, Gao Sheng's father was publicly executed.

In that moment, Gao Sheng's "Id" learned a bloody lesson: "Will," without "probability" to back it up, is just a foolish form of suicide.

#### Growth: Playing the "Model Corrupt Official"

The "Ministry of Integration" needed a new "white glove" to manage the chaotic "Hundred-Yue Ports"—they needed someone to handle the "dirty" business they wouldn't touch, and to "use criminals to control criminals."

They chose Gao Sheng, the "traitor's" son.

Gao Sheng's "Ego" made the most perfect "calculation." He needed to survive, and he needed "capital." He completely abandoned his father's "nobility" and put on a "greasy, greedy, non-threatening" mask. He became the "Presidium's" favorite "model corrupt official"—a useless "young master" who only cared about debauchery and money.

He ran the Gao casino with great success. On the surface, he strictly followed the "Presidium's" rules, handing over most of the profits. Secretly, he used the casino to accumulate three things:

- **Money (Capital)**: The "fuel" to start any plan.
- **Blackmail Material (Chips)**: Every "Integrator" cadre who came to the casino to indulge, their drunken words, their greedy faces, all became Gao Sheng's "chips."
- **Connections (Network)**: The casino was a crossroads for all walks of life. He used it to build an underground intelligence network that spanned "The Harmony" and even the "Gray Mirror Alliance."

#### The Superego's Hidden Goal:

He never forgot his father's death. His "Superego"—the deeply hidden rebel—hated this "prison of consciousness." He was waiting, using his actuary's brain, for a "Wild Card" to appear. A variable that could shift his "zero-win" hand to "not zero."

He wants to overthrow the "House" (the Consortium/Presidium). He wants to play a "real" game.

## 2. Isa — "The Moon"

### "The Frozen Moonlight"

- **Role**: Faith / Soul / Power
- **Real Name**: Isa Skadira (tentative, incorporating the Skadi myth)
- **Royal Title**: Princess Bright-Mirror
- **Underground Alias**: Ying Yue (Shadow Moon)
- **Affiliation**: Sole heir to "The Ice-Mirror Kingdom" (destroyed).
- **Identity**: Princess of a fallen kingdom; undefeated fighter in the "Hundred-Yue Ports" black market; Gao Sheng's "secret ace."
- **Philosophy**:
> "The Consortium controls with 'desire,' the Harmony binds with 'fear.' But the 'Frost' will freeze it all. In my father's name, I will take back what is ours."

### Backstory: From "White Snow" to "Mire"

#### Prologue: The Destruction of the Ice-Mirror Kingdom

The first half of Isa's life was "white" and "pure."

She was born in the northernmost part of the "Henglu" continent, in an ancient, isolated kingdom not on any map—the "Ice-Mirror Kingdom." There, everything was made of ice crystals, and the people believed in **"The Frost Will."** This was a spiritual philosophy of extreme "calm" and "self-discipline." They used "ice crystal meditation" to resist all external "noise" that sought to pollute their "autonomous consciousness."

The faith of the "Ice-Mirror Kingdom" was the natural enemy of the "prison of consciousness" designed by the Consortium's AI.
The Consortium's "Compact" enslaves people with "passion" and "desire."
The Consortium's "Harmony" enslaves people with "fanaticism" and "fear."
And "The Frost Will" can break both.

Therefore, the "Consortium" classified the "Ice-Mirror Kingdom" as the highest threat. They secretly funded the "Presidium" of the "People's Harmony" to wage a war of annihilation "off the map."

On the last day of the war, the King (Isa's father) gave her and her brother two "national treasures":

- She (Isa) received **"The Frost Heart,"** a necklace relic (Skadi's starry eyes), which stored all the kingdom's memories and the supreme power of the "Frost Will" (i.e., "magic").
- Her brother (the Prince) received **"The Ice-Mirror Sacred Spear,"** a weapon capable of killing gods.

The prince led the last of the Royal Guard to hold back the "Ministry of Integration's" pursuers, buying time for Isa to escape. She watched as her brother and her kingdom disappeared in a sea of fire and blizzards.

#### Growth: Becoming "Ying Yue"

Isa fled from the frigid "North" across the "Henglu" continent to the most "filthy," "chaotic," but also the best place to "hide" everything: the "Hundred-Yue Ports."

To survive, and more importantly, to hide the immense energy fluctuations of the "Frost Heart" ("magic") that could be detected by the "Consortium's" satellites, a kingdom elder placed a **"bloodline seal"** on her before dying. Her "divine power" was locked away, and her "princess memories" were suppressed.

She was left with only two things:

- The echo of the "Frost Will"—granting her superhuman "calm" and "combat intuition."
- The hatred of a destroyed nation.

She abandoned the name "Isa" and took an alias that best represented her current state—"Ying Yue" (Shadow Moon). From the "Bright-Mirror" princess, she fell to become the moon of "shadow."

She became a black market fighter at the lowest level of the "Hundred-Yue Ports." She found her slender body to be a disadvantage (compared to gangster thugs), but her "combat intuition" from the "Frost Will" was invincible. She didn't rely on brute force, but on "skill" and "timing"—to strike down the most powerful enemies at the most perfect moment.

#### Gao Sheng's (The Sun's) "Discovery"

Gao Sheng (the gambling king) discovered this "monster" in his underground fighting ring. A slender girl with an undefeated record of 50 matches. He (the house) saw through her "probability"—her "wins" were not based on "luck," but on a kind of **"inevitability."**

Gao Sheng placed a huge bet on her. He "bought" her out of the fighting ring, freed her from combat, and trained her to be his most trusted and mysterious "ace." He didn't know she was a princess, but he knew that this woman was the **only "variable" in his "zero-win" hand.**

### Weapon and Magic: "The Frost Morpher"

(Note: The spear is currently in the hands of her missing brother, but it is a weapon she is destined to reclaim.)

**Core Concept**: This is not an ordinary "spear," but the pinnacle of the "Ice-Mirror Kingdom's" technology—a **"Nano-Ice Crystal Tech" weapon** that requires "royal blood" (an innate advantage) to activate.

#### Form One: Short Spear Mode (Hunting)

*(Alludes to Zhao Yun / Skadi's agility)*

When activated, it is a moderately long short spear with a tip made of ultra-dense "ice crystals." Extremely light and agile, suitable for Isa (Ying Yue) in underground fights or urban alley brawls for high-speed evasion and thrusts.

#### Form Two: Longbow Mode (Judgment)

*(Alludes to Skadi's bow / Compound bow)*

The spear's body can transform and unfold from the middle, and the "energy core" in the handle will draw an "ice-frost energy string."

It doesn't shoot "arrows," but **"high-speed ice crystal arrows"**—this is the key she will use for long-range assassinations and precision strikes against the "Consortium's" top brass.

#### Form Three: Sacred Spear Mode (Liberation)

*(Alludes to Zhang Fei / Ragnarok)*

Can only be activated after the "bloodline seal" is broken. Isa combines the "Frost Heart" (necklace) with the "Sacred Spear," and the spear's body will grow to three meters, its tip releasing a visible "aurora."

This is her "god-killing" form, powerful enough to fight the "Consortium's" war machines.

### Magic System: The Sealed "Frost Will"

**Essence of Magic**: "Calm Awakening"

Her "magic" is the materialization of the "Frost Will." When she breaks the seal, she can:

- **Freeze Emotions (against enemies)**: Release a "calm aura" that instantly "freezes" the enemy's fanaticism, fear, and desire—temporarily disabling the "Consortium's" "desire" manipulation and the "Harmony's" "fear" brainwashing.
- **Melt Heart-Locks (for allies)**: Use the "pure" power of the "Frost" to touch the hearts of allies (like Gao Sheng or Xing Wangchen), helping them to "calm down" and break free from the mental pollution of the "prison of consciousness" (e.g., hallucinations, guilt, despair).

**Sealing and Unsealing**:

- **Reason for Sealing**: A kingdom elder protected her by preventing the "Consortium's" "global consciousness monitoring AI" from detecting this powerful "will fluctuation."
- **Condition for Unsealing**: Her "bloodline" must be combined with "key technology." She needs a "medium" to safely release this power without being detected by the "Consortium." This "medium" is the **"Creation Engine."**

Ying Yue is the incarnation of Skadi, the goddess of snow in Norse mythology. Her story and powers will profoundly influence her character development in the "Creation Engine."
1. Skadi as a spiritual symbol: supporting the character's "core"
In Norse mythology, Skadi is an ice princess who avenges her father but ultimately chooses peaceful negotiation, symbolizing "calm tenacity, from hatred to forgiveness"—this is very suitable for your female protagonist (let's call her Isa, Ice Sha, inspired by Skadi). She is not purely an avenger, but uses wisdom and love to break the prison:
Spiritual Pillar: Isa's faith is the "Frost Will"—ice and snow represent a pure, uncontrollable autonomous consciousness (the people of the ancient kingdom used ice crystal meditation to resist brainwashing). Skadi's story of revenge symbolizes Isa's starting point: after her kingdom is destroyed, she hides in the world, appearing weak but with a heart as hard as an iceberg. This symbol makes her three-dimensional—not just fighting, but also internal struggle (for example, when facing manipulators, she will recall Skadi's "three-condition negotiation," using strategy rather than brute force to escape).
Archetypal Difference: Isa is not equal to Skadi, but borrows her "ice-snow guardian" image: for example, Isa has a necklace relic (inspired by Skadi's starry eyes) that contains the memories of the ancient kingdom, reminding her that "free will is like a snowflake, fragile but endless."
Tips for Three-Dimensionality: Add inner monologues that make her question social manipulation ("Corporations use advertising to manipulate desire, families use guilt to bind hearts, the environment uses fear to lock down dreams—but ice and snow will melt the cage"). This makes her less of a flat hero and gives her a growth arc.
2. Weapon design: high-tech transforming spear (compound bow + spear fusion)
You mentioned "compound attack" (I guess you mean "compound bow"?), and "spear"—I understand you want to modernize the bow and arrow into a high-tech weapon, because the female character is relatively weak and needs an innate advantage or enhanced tools to use it long-term. Skadi originally used a bow and arrow for hunting, so it fits in naturally! I suggest designing the weapon as a "Frost Morpher," fusing bow and spear elements, high-tech + ancient kingdom genetic enhancement, to give her greater power:
Core Concept: This weapon is an ancient kingdom relic that uses nano-ice crystal technology (high-tech) and requires Isa's "innate bloodline" (princess lineage) to activate—otherwise, ordinary people will get frostbite. This solves the weakness problem: she doesn't rely on brute force, but on her wisdom to switch forms and respond flexibly.
Transformation Modes (inspired by Three Kingdoms weapons, modernized):
Short Spear Mode: Like Zhao Yun's Dragon's Bile Spear (agile close combat), as tall as a person, with an ice blade tip that can shoot high-speed ice arrows (compound bow function). Suitable for underground fighting, quick evasion + thrusts, symbolizing Skadi's hunting agility.
Long Spear Mode: Like Zhang Fei's Serpent Spear, extending to 3 meters, the spear body becomes a hard ice pillar, able to sweep through crowds of enemies. Suitable for defensive battles, piercing the "emotional barriers" of the prison of consciousness (for example, destroying manipulation devices).
Whip Spear Mode: Like a nine-section whip + side spear, the spear body becomes flexible in sections, able to whip or entangle enemies, with the tip shooting an ice net to capture. Suitable for strategic battles, symbolizing the reversal of the manipulator's "soft traps."
Enhancement Mechanism: The weapon has an "energy core" (borrowing from Skadi's ice magic), and long-term use requires Isa's willpower (innate advantage), otherwise it will overload. Modern interesting elements: add AI assistance (but Isa has it blocked to avoid being hacked by the Consortium), or have light effects during transformation (like an aurora).
Power Balance: In physical mode, she relies on skill; but after her magic is unsealed, the weapon upgrades—ice arrows become energy bolts, the spear body summons avalanches, doubling its power.
3. Magic setting: sealed ability + recovery condition
Skadi was originally a goddess of snow with the power to control cold. Your Isa can borrow from this, but add a "sealing" mechanism to create tension in the story:
Magic Power: 10 times stronger than physical combat—for example, a physical spear can only hit a single target, while magic can freeze all the consciousness manipulation devices in a room, or create a "willpower shield" to resist emotional brainwashing. Core element: ice and snow magic symbolizes "calm awakening," which can "freeze" enemy emotions (making the manipulator's panic ineffective), or "melt" the heart-locks of allies (liberating the brainwashed).
Sealing Details (you said "fine words," I guess you mean "details"?): Isa's magic was sealed by a kingdom elder when she was a child to hide her identity and avoid detection by the Consortium (magic fluctuations would be captured by satellites). Condition: until she "recovers her princess identity"—for example, by finding the crown relic, or by swearing an oath of faith in a critical crisis (like Skadi's oath of revenge). After unsealing, the magic has side effects (like temporary weakness), so she doesn't abuse it.
Symbolic Integration: The magic comes from Skadi's "winter protection"—when Isa uses magic, she will have visions (seeing an ice palace), reminding her of her kingdom's mission. This makes the magic not just a tool, but a spiritual support.
Overall Character Three-Dimensionality Suggestions
Background Arc: Start—a hidden fighter, using a physical spear to resist small-scale manipulation (corporate brainwashing of employees). Middle—meets comrades, discovers the secrets of the ancient kingdom, gradually unseals her magic. End—recovers her identity, uses magic + spear to break the prison and create a free space.
Deepen the Conflict: Her weak appearance hides her strength, making her struggle when facing emotional manipulation (for example, family memories make her hesitate). Spiritual Symbol: After each battle, she meditates on Skadi's story to strengthen her will.
Link to the Story's Theme: The prison of consciousness uses emotional manipulation (fear, desire, guilt). Isa's ice and snow symbolize "calm detachment," and by borrowing from Skadi's peaceful negotiations, she emphasizes "awakening rather than destruction."
This setting has a lot of potential, it feels like it could be written into a series of novels! Do you want me to write a battle scene of Isa using the transforming spear (in Cantonese), or detail the plot of her magic being unsealed? Or add more conspiracy elements like a mole in the Consortium? Just say the word, and I'll keep brainstorming! ❄️🏹🔫

## 3. Xing Wangchen — "The Star"

### "The Lost Navigator"

- **Role**: Mind / Blueprint / Future
- **Affiliation**: The Aurelian Compact
- **Identity**: Former top AI scientist for the "Consortium"; a wandering singer on the "Gilded Coast" (a disguise).
- **Philosophy**:
> If the rules are wrong, make new ones.

### Backstory: The "Defector" Who Saw Through the Stars

#### Prologue: The Void at the Top

The first half of Xing Wangchen's life was "golden."

He was born on the "Gilded Coast" of the "Aurelian Compact," an absolute winner of "The Mimetic Tower-Climb." With his unparalleled talent, he became the chief scientist of the "Consortium's" AI lab.

His job was to design algorithms to "control" the world:

- He designed more addictive "financial instruments" and "social media" for the "Compact," exacerbating the "involution."
- He upgraded the "facial recognition" and "thought monitoring" systems for the "Harmony" (as a B2B business for the "Consortium").

Until one day, he discovered a "classified file"—the "Project: Skadi" operation log, about the "Consortium" and "Harmony" joining forces to exterminate the "Ice-Mirror Kingdom."

He was shocked to discover that everything the "Consortium" did was not just for "profit," but to eliminate an "ideology" they could not understand or control—the "Frost Will."

#### Growth: Becoming a "Wanderer"

Xing Wangchen's "Id" (the scientist/artist) awakened. He realized he wasn't "creating," but "reinforcing a prison."

He initiated his defection plan. He deleted his research, faked a lab accident, and had himself "declared dead." He gave up everything, falling from the top of the "Gilded Coast" to become a penniless "street singer."

He "encrypted" all his understanding of the "Consortium's" AI, the methods to crack the "prison of consciousness," and the scattered secrets of the "Ice-Mirror Kingdom" into his songs and poems.

He was no longer a "scientist." He was "Star"—a lone navigator shining in the dark, waiting for a "stargazer."

#### The Superego's Goal:

He wants to build **"The Creation Engine."**

He was inspired by the remaining data from the "Ice-Mirror Kingdom": if the "Consortium's" AI runs on "passion" and "fanaticism," then he will create a "new universe" based on "calm" and "pure reason" (or the "Frost Will").

But he was missing a "core"—a **"non-standardized will"** that the "Consortium's" AI could not simulate or invade.

---

## 4. The Trinity: The Interaction of Sun, Moon, and Star

### The Ignition of the "Creation Engine"

#### Phase One: The Meeting (Sun and Moon)

Gao Sheng (Sun) discovers Isa/Ying Yue (Moon) in his black market fighting ring. He (the gambling king) doesn't understand her "martial arts," but he understands her "will." He sees her as his "ultimate trump card," a "non-probabilistic" being, and hides her away, making her his deepest secret.

#### Phase Two: The Collision (Star and Moon)

Xing Wangchen (Star) wanders to the "Hundred-Yue Ports" and sings his "encrypted" song (about the "Consortium" and the "Frost") outside Gao Sheng's casino.

Gao Sheng (the gambling king) hears the "rebellion" in the song and secretly brings him in.

When Xing Wangchen (the scientist) meets Isa (the princess), the gears of history begin to turn.

Xing Wangchen's instruments (possibly hidden in his guitar) detect a faint but "impossible" energy fluctuation on Isa—the echo of the **"Frost Will."**

- **Star (the scientist)**: "Oh my god... you... you're a survivor of 'Project: Skadi'? You are the core of the 'Frost Will'?!"
- **Moon (Isa)**: (Shocked, as it's the first time she's heard someone speak the secret of her bloodline) "Who... who are you?"

#### Phase Three: The Activation (Sun, Moon, and Star)

Xing (Xing Wangchen) is ecstatic. He's found it! He's found the one missing "Divine Core" for his "Creation Engine."

Moon (Isa) has found "hope." She (the incarnation of Skadi) realizes that this scientist's (Star's) "engine" is the only "medium" for her to unseal and release the power of the "Frost Heart"!

Sun (Gao Sheng) listens to all of this. His (the gambling king's) mind is racing. He's finally found it!

He has the "money" (Sun).
He has the "blueprint for rebellion" (Star).
He has the "divinely chosen weapon" (Moon).

Gao Sheng (Sun) smiles, puts all his "capital" on the table, and says: "I don't know what you're talking about with 'engines' and 'princesses.' All I know is that the **'1% chance of winning'** I've been waiting for my whole life... has finally appeared. Let's play!"

### Summary:

- **Sun (Gao Sheng)** is the **"capital," he decides "how much they can do."**
- **Star (Xing Wangchen)** is the **"blueprint," he decides "how they can do it."**
- **Moon (Isa)** is the **"power," she decides "why they must do it."**

The three of them, in the deepest part of Gao Sheng's underground casino, will secretly activate the "Creation Engine," igniting the final battle against the "Consortium"—this "false universe."
