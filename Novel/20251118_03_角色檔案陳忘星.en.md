# Character Profile: Chen Wangxing

> "The system wants to fill your every second, because the moment you stop, you are no longer data, but a receiver of divinity."

## 1. Basic Information

- **Title:** The Gap Walker / The Observer of Universe 25
- **Home World:** Universe 25 (The real world / Material plane)
- **Professional Disguise:** Marginalized indie developer / Struggling novelist
- **Core Attributes:** Neutrality, Awareness, Quantum Resonance
- **Mental State:** Both weary and clear-headed. Constantly in a state of "observing the world while being in it," feeling detached from the secular money game, but holding a deep compassion for "people."

## 2. Character Background: "Frequency Tuning" Brought by Death

Chen Wangxing was once a cog about to burn out in this high-pressure society, until he experienced multiple near-death experiences of "out-of-body" travel.

In those moments on the edge of death, his consciousness broke free from the physical laws of Universe 25 and glimpsed a higher-dimensional existence—namely, the **"Creation World" (Aurelion)**.

He was shocked to realize that the real world (Universe 25) is heading towards a "Dharma-Ending Age," and human spirituality is withering. He realized he is a "receiver," and his brain has become a bridge connecting the two universes.

## 3. The Enemy: Algorithmic Bureaucracy and the Remnants of the Reptilians

He saw the truth of the real world—it is a matrix driven by **"fear and anxiety."**

- **Control Mechanism:** The lurking "Reptilian remnants" do not appear directly, but have established an "invisible prison" through AI and algorithms.
- **Methods:** Using extreme left-right opposition, efficiency-first mentality driven by money, and endless information feeds to "fill up" human consciousness.
- **Purpose:** To eliminate the **"neutral space"** within humans, keeping people busy reacting, taking sides, and surviving, thus preventing them from generating the "creativity" that originally belongs to divinity, and reducing them to batteries that provide negative emotional energy (Loosh).

## 4. Core Ability: The Consciousness Gap

Chen Wangxing does not have physical superpowers; what he has is the ability to **"chisel out air in a hermetically sealed system."**

- **Definition:** The "Gap" is the area of human consciousness not yet fully occupied by the system, inertia, and algorithms. It is the fault line between the "automatically operating self" and the "observing self."
- **How the Ability Works:**
    - **Interrupting Inertia:** He can write special code or text (like the "Creation Engine" story) that carries frequencies from another world.
    - **Forcing a Pause:** When people come into contact with his work or app, their brain's original "anxiety loop" is interrupted, and they enter a brief state of "micro-meditation."
    - **Downloading Divinity:** In the moment this "Gap" opens, he can guide the spiritual power of the three protagonists from the other world (Sun, Moon, and Star) into the reader's subconscious, awakening their dormant souls.

## 5. Specific Plan: Project Mythogen (The Trojan Horse)

To avoid the censorship of the Reptilian algorithms, he cannot directly preach "awakening," but must "cultivate truth through falsehood."

- **Surface Disguise (The App):** A seemingly ordinary **"Food Recognition and Cooking App."**
    - **Function:** Take a photo to identify ingredients and generate recipes.
    - **True Intent:** To counter "fast-food culture." By guiding users to touch real ingredients and experience the process of cooking, it shifts them from "result-oriented (getting full/efficiency)" to "experience-oriented (perception/living)." Every chop of the knife is an exercise in "leaving blank space" against algorithmic control.

- **Deeper Carrier (The Story):** The novel "Creation Engine."
    - He writes the true history of the other world as a novel, hiding the "awakening technology" in the plot. Readers think they are reading a fantasy story, but they are actually undergoing consciousness decoding.

## 6. Resonance with the Other World (Universe 15)

Chen Wangxing is the "anchor point" in reality for the three giants of the other world:

- **【Star】Xing Wangchen ↔ Chen Wangxing:**
    - **Resonance Point:** "Awareness." When Chen Wangxing opens the "Consciousness Gap" in reality, he can receive the trans-dimensional wisdom of Xing Wangchen. Xing Wangchen is his mirror image in the other world, representing the eye that "sees through illusion."
- **【Sun】Gao Sheng ↔ Chen Wangxing's ability to act:**
    - **Resonance Point:** "Order and Righteous Law." Chen Wangxing relies on Gao Sheng's energy to maintain his inner firmness, insisting on "neutrality" in this chaotic reality without being consumed by extremism.
- **【Moon】Ying Yue ↔ Chen Wangxing's compassion:**
    - **Resonance Point:** "Connection." Ying Yue's energy allows Chen Wangxing to retain a keen perception of the "human heart" when facing cold AI and data, to understand the suffering of others and offer comfort.

## 7. Character Motto and Course of Action

> **Strategy:** "Do not fight the darkness, just light the light; do not attack the system, just create gaps."
>
> **Ultimate Goal:** Before Universe 15 collapses and the Dharma-Ending Age descends on Universe 25, to filter and transfer enough awakened souls through the "Consciousness Gap," completing the ascension from "data slaves" to "Creators."
