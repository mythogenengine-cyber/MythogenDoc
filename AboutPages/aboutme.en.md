# Welcome to <Mythogen Engine>—A Thought Laboratory for Processing Chaos and Distilling Value.

In a world that appears orderly but is turbulent beneath the surface, we often feel powerless. "Order" becomes a veil that conceals the truth, and the "system" betrays us without our knowledge. The flood of information drowns out independent thought, and standard answers stifle true possibilities.

I am **mythogen.engine 星忘塵 Wang Chen**, an explorer in the torrent of information, an imperfect practitioner. I founded <Mythogen Engine> not to provide new answers, but to ask more fundamental questions.

This is a crucible of ideas, a battlefield of the spirit. Together, we will:

*   **Unveil the Curtain**: Challenge the rules and orders that are taken for granted.
*   **Process the Chaos**: Dive into the deep sea of information, unafraid of contradictions and complexity.
*   **Distill the Value**: From the deconstructed fragments, find and reforge our own meaning and truth.

> "It is not I who have betrayed the system, but the system that has betrayed us."

If you resonate with this statement and long to penetrate the surface to touch the essence, then you are welcome to join this thought experiment.

At <Mythogen Engine>, we do not pursue perfection, only **truth**.
