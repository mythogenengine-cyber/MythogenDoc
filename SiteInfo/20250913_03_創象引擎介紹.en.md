# Introduction to the Imaginarium Engine

> My world is composed of images. This is its translator.

## A Personal Thought Experiment

Since childhood, my thoughts have not been composed of words, but of flowing cinematic scenes. These images are rich in information and intention, yet they have also caused me to learn more slowly than others in a world dominated by text.

Words are precise tools for communication, but they can hardly carry the mystery of ancient murals, the weight of knotted records, or depict the complex imagery that merges culture, history, and personal memory. What I see and what I think often gets lost in translation when converted into words.

## From "Intention" to "Creation"

And so, I created the "Imaginarium Engine."

It is not a platform open to everyone, but an extension of my own consciousness that I built for myself. It can understand the chaotic, fragmented ideas in my mind, capturing a single core **"Intention."**

Through AI, this engine can transform a single intention into an article, a formula, a short film, or even a micro-movie. It mimics my way of thinking, systematically weaving unstructured inspiration into various forms of information that can be understood and felt.

## Why Do This?

Undoubtedly, this technology has immense commercial potential and could simplify countless complex communication processes.

But before exploring all that, I just want to return to the purest of intentionsâ€”to use it to tell some stories that I myself want to tell.

I want to invite you, through this engine, to see how different the world of a person who thinks in pictures can be.
