# In the Fog of AI and Knowledge Monetization: How to Distinguish Truth from Scams?

In today's era, the internet is like a massive melting pot filled with various free learning resources. Whether through AI assistance for information search, retrieval, and classification, or watching YouTube videos, reading professional articles, and communicating with people on social media, we indeed have unprecedented opportunities to learn vast amounts of knowledge without spending a penny.

> However, a contradictory phenomenon has emerged: Why, when free resources are so readily available, is the market flooded with various paid courses emphasizing "knowledge monetization" and "get rich quick"? And why do these courses, after claiming to be "free" at the beginning, ultimately give people negative impressions of direct sales or even fraud?

This is a question I have been thinking about for a long time.

## The Value Spectrum of Learning Methods: From "Clear Transactions" to "Mysterious Scams"

First, we must acknowledge the value of different learning methods.

Most of my learning has been free. Among these, **books** are what I consider the most "cost-effective" learning medium. Although slow, books are refined compilations of authors' thoughts with relatively minimal "noise." Even better, bookstores provide browsing opportunities, and libraries allow old books to circulate, making the threshold for acquiring knowledge extremely low.

Of course, paid learning also has irreplaceable value. I once spent nearly a year participating in an AI programming organization. Although the cost was substantial, the greatest gain was meeting industry mentors and experts, gaining insight into the real standards and levels of this industry—a perspective difficult to obtain through self-study alone.

This experience also gave me deep insight into two completely different models of paid education:

### First Type: "Clear Transactions" with Transparent Deals
This is like tutoring for specific exams or skill courses for learning specific tools. In this model, the scope, content, and objectives of teaching are extremely clear and transparent. As a student, you clearly know what you expect to learn and what you need. This is a healthy market mechanism that at most has quality differences in "how well it's taught," without fundamental questions of "whether it's a scam."

### Second Type: "Mysterious Courses" Questioned as Scams
These courses typically involve life coaching, entrepreneurial mindsets, non-orthodox psychology (such as overly packaged positive psychology), spiritual exploration, and other abstract fields. The core problem here is not the "topics themselves" but their "business models."

If these views on life, observations on psychology, and philosophical thoughts on creation could be shared at the price of a meal like a book, I would strongly support them. When I read such books, my mindset is to have an intellectual dialogue with the author, aiming to absorb experience and broaden perspectives, never expecting to "definitely learn something" or "guarantee getting something."

However, the problem with these "mysterious courses" is that they transform simple experience sharing into elaborate scams. Their characteristics include:

- **Exaggerated and false promises of effectiveness**: Claiming to completely change your life or financial situation.
- **Astronomical tuition fees**: Demanding high costs completely disproportionate to content value.
- **Pyramid-style sales packaging**: Using direct sales-like tactics, encouraging students to recruit more people.

It is precisely this combination that transforms what could have been a simple, positive concept into an elaborately designed scam.

## The Double-Edged Sword of the AI Era: Democratization of Creation and Dilution of Soul

In recent years, AI development has completely changed the threshold for creation. In the past, you might need to spend enormous amounts of time learning to draw a picture or write a piece of code. But now, AI has made many previously unreachable skills as simple as pressing a few buttons. It can be said that 80-90% of basic application needs might only require less than 20% of total knowledge to achieve.

This brings unprecedented convenience but also triggers new crises: **content homogenization and loss of soul**.

When creators no longer need deep thinking, merely giving a command and applying a style (Style Mask) to let AI generate works, these outputs lose their uniqueness. I compare this phenomenon to an **"automatic slot machine."** Although it might have a million combinations, its foundation remains the same system, unable to produce truly breakthrough thinking, emotions, and ideas. What AI presents is "imitation" of existing human emotions and wisdom through probability and combination, not true creation.

This trend is seriously impacting the content industry. Yesterday I saw a YouTuber (seems to be called "Wanshi") mention that current anime is increasingly difficult to follow patiently because content has become hollow. The reason behind this is that when computer graphics reduced creation costs, fierce competition and difficult-to-recover investments forced businesspeople to concentrate resources on the "attention economy"—using sensational clickbait, hyping products and trends to replace deep research into content itself. AI's proliferation will only push this problem to more extreme levels, forcing accelerated creation and declining quality.

Many people comfort themselves with "high productivity brings high quality," but without sufficient thinking, no amount of output is just spinning in place, unable to refine true masterpieces. History repeats itself, like when Stephen Chow filmed "King of Comedy"—he had extremely high quality requirements but was forced to hastily finish due to disagreements with producers, becoming a long-lasting regret. Under commercial pressure, true creative freedom is such a luxury.

## The Creator's Dilemma: When Sincerity and Lies Wear the Same Clothes

> This leads to what I consider the biggest pain point for contemporary creators and educators: you and scammers are doing the same things, saying the same words.

Those courses flying the banners of "knowledge monetization" and "entrepreneurship education" are essentially scams. They plagiarize, imitate, and repackage the hard work of real creators, then promote them using more manipulative marketing techniques (which I call "viral cultural invasion"). They use advertisements and carefully designed sales funnels to drown out creators who genuinely want to share for free or provide authentic content.

This reminds me of a scene from "Yu Yu Hakusho": enemies can freely transform into Kuwabara or Yusuke, possessing the same memories and saying the same words. How do you distinguish who is real and who is fake?

When a scammer uses all their energy to promote plagiarized content, speaking the same ideals as you and doing similar things, although they lack the core of content, how many people can tell the difference? What you say sounds like what scammers say; what you do looks like what scammers do. You want to change direction and alter your approach, only to find they quickly imitate and follow. This is a despairing situation.

### A Classic Case of Truth and Falsehood: "Rich Dad, Poor Dad"

In college, I read "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" twice. At the time, I didn't know this book had close ties to direct sales systems, but I noticed many direct sales practitioners treated it as gospel.

Some concepts in the book greatly inspired me, such as: **houses are assets** because they have appreciation potential; while **cars and game consoles are liabilities** because their value only continues to depreciate. This concept of "assets" versus "consumption," and the thinking that wealth is linked to purchasing power rather than simple money, is correct and important.

However, when I became deeply interested in the "cash flow game" mentioned in the book and inquired everywhere, I repeatedly hit walls, with many people immediately becoming wary and asking: "Are you trying to sell me something? Are you doing direct sales?"

Later, I learned from a master's degree friend majoring in mathematics that the "cash flow game" is like "Monopoly"—its rules are built on many assumptions that don't match reality. For example, it assumes assets always continue to appreciate, but real-world economic fluctuations are far more complex. This game simplifies real-world rules, environmental conditions, and human nature, more like a tool for ideological indoctrination than rigorous financial education.

This example perfectly illustrates my confusion: how a concept with partial value can be abused, distorted, ultimately equated with scams, and contaminate an entire field of knowledge.

## My Path: From Paid Teaching to "Loose Parts" Free Sharing

Facing such dilemmas, I began thinking about my positioning.

I once considered paid teaching, but now I choose free sharing. The reason is that AI-related knowledge and technology have very short shelf lives. The tools I teach you today might be outdated by the time you learn them. Therefore, customized courses for specific needs don't make much sense.

My knowledge is like **"spare parts from Gundam model kits."** For someone assembling the same model who happens to need this specific part, it's invaluable. But for the general public, this part is useless. My goal is to freely share these "loose knowledge parts," hoping to precisely hit those very few people who truly need them.

This isn't traditional "course selling"—I can't guarantee what you'll "get" after completing the course. What I share is just a reference, a record of my learning and practice process. But I believe if you find it useful, the best reward is helping me with "viral marketing"—like "The Ring," pass this material to seven people. As long as someone finds value in it, pass it on again.

I believe that when you sincerely help people, traffic and opportunities will naturally follow. This is fundamentally different from those scams that initially hide risks and difficulties, telling you "just pay for the course, press a button, and you'll succeed."

My ultimate goal is to explore a path that allows genuine knowledge and goodwill to find their own light in this era of indistinguishable truth and falsehood.
