A Gentle Accusation About the Different: My Novel Creation Blueprint
I am conceiving a novel that originates from a very personal starting point and attempts to explore the dilemmas and internal struggles faced by those who are "different" in society.

The Origin of the Story: From "Star Plucker" to a Deeper Mystery
I initially wanted to name this novel "Star Plucker," with myself as the protagonist. But later I thought that this story needed a title and narrative style that could create more suspense and make people want to investigate.

The protagonist of the story is a character named "Chen Wangxing" or "Xing Wangchen." This name comes from an AI's suggestion, meaning "to wash away the lead and powder, to forget the past," symbolizing a middle-aged career changer who must let go of all stubbornness and start over completely.

However, this protagonist is not easy to understand. He is a genius with an IQ of up to 150, and at the same time has the characteristics of Asperger's syndrome, bordering on madness. A "genius" like him cannot succeed in the current examination system, because this system is designed for "smart, obedient children," not for true mavericks.

Core Trait: The Gift of "Visual Thinking"
Another important trigger for writing this novel is my son. He and I have extremely similar traits.

When he was five years old, I was teaching him to write games, and he was able to comprehend and describe the concept of "multi-dimensional coordinates" that transcend three dimensions, even involving timelines and multiple endings. His way of speaking is very special, not in complete sentences, but by directly describing the scattered fragments full of images in his mind.

This is the ability of "visual thinking."

This ability allows him to handle multi-digit multiplication through a mental image without a calculator. It's like when we played mahjong as children, we saw an image of a three of circles and a four of circles, and we could directly "see" them combine into a seven of circles, rather than through the numerical calculation of "3+4=7."
The current education system divides multiplication problems into "multiplicand" and "multiplier," and even if the answer is the same, it still requires strict distinction in word or grammar problems.
For example: "An apple costs two yuan, and you buy three." Logically, it's 2×3 = 6 yuan.
But that's not how it is now. They will require that it must be written as "two yuan multiplied by three," because the problem is set as "buying an apple for two yuan three times," so it must be written as 2×3. If it is written as 3×2, it will be marked as wrong.
I think this approach is simply creating confusion.

Ancient systems of measurement, such as one catty being sixteen taels (two eight taels), or the eight trigrams of the I Ching, actually contain the same principle: through images and symbols, one can recognize the quantity they represent at a glance, without having to count them one by one. For people with this gift, numbers themselves are a picture.

Society's Framework: Exclusion and Bullying of the "Different"
This world is full of exclusion, bullying, and ubiquitous pressure for people who think differently, forcing you to conform to the existing system.

1. The Rigidity of Education:
My ten-year-old son has had nightmares about going to school since kindergarten. The teacher forced him to accept a logic he couldn't agree with. For example, why is "2x3" not equal to "3x2"? In his visual thinking, "three twos" and "two threes" are completely different arrangements. This rigid definition is endless in the education of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and even the United States, stifling children's intuitive understanding.

2. Communication Barriers:
The academic and professional worlds are full of confusing "jargon" and unnecessary rules. You can clearly use "expert," but you have to create a word like "pro-gamer"; in the game Werewolf, there are clearly more intuitive words, but you have to invent insider slang like "golden water" and "silver water."

A more common example is that every company has to create its own set of definitions for technologies that already have recognized terms. This leads to chaos in cross-company collaboration just in defining terms. We are obsessed with the definition of "won't boot up," but we forget that the user's most fundamental problem is actually "unusable." We always replace simple facts with complex definitions, and then write these unwritten rules in documents that no one will ever check.

3. The Unwritten Rules of the Workplace:
In workplace culture, it is often "relationships first, feelings second, and theory last." If you don't know how to build relationships and just want to discuss matters on their merits, then no matter how urgent the matter is, you will only end up as cannon fodder.

The Protagonist's Inner World: Division, Remorse, and Redemption
The protagonist of the novel, in such an environment, has sealed his brilliant "id" for nearly twenty years. He even, in a way similar to multiple personality disorder, has locked that true self deep in his subconscious, only to be glimpsed in dreams or hypnosis.

His life is full of remorse. Because no matter how he goes with the flow, what he does is not what he truly agrees with. He watches helplessly as society decays,明明 there are countless ways to solve problems, but he is powerless.

What pains him the most is having to go along with the flow in order to survive: swallowing his anger, distorting himself, framing others, forming cliques, and finding scapegoats. When these behaviors escalate, even to the point of driving someone to suicide, the system still chooses to cover it up. Many people, like the characters in the novel, in order to adapt to society, split off a "good self" and a "self that will do whatever it takes," torn between the two, but ultimately choose the latter.

I also admit that in order to adapt, I have also split into different personalities, not daring to show that cynical, proud self in reality.

The Novel's Mission: To Speak for Those in Hell
So, I want to write this novel.

I want to use a gentle way to tell the story of the protagonist "Chen Wangxing," and also the stories of countless people who suffer in the system. I want to let more people know through building my own media and creating novels that we are not "without choice." Society uses all kinds of emotional blackmail to tell you: "For the sake of your family, for a good life, you must endure." But this endurance often comes at a great price.

My goal is to organize and adapt these social events into a story, to speak for those who are crying out in hell. Let the readers see what is happening, and then decide for themselves which path to take.

You don't have to agree, but for those who don't agree but love to watch, love to scold, and even attack people personally instead of addressing the issue, I won't care. When you see so many people struggling in suffering, you will understand that this is something that must be done.
