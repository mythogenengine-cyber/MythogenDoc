„Äê Creation Log: The Eternal War Between Tools and Content üí¨ „Äë
As a creator, do you often find yourself in a dilemma: should you perfect your tools and systems to 100% before anything else, or should you just dive in and start producing content?
Recently, while developing my personal project, the "Mythogen Engine," I hit this wall hard.
The original intention of this project was to create a platform that could systematically organize all my thoughts, notes, and worldviews. I firmly believed that with the perfect tool, content production could be much more efficient. But the reality is, I spent a huge amount of time writing code, researching technology, and because of frequent testing, I quickly used up all my free quotas for Claude, Gemini CLI, Copilot, and even Vercel.
The result was that the progress on the tool was slow, and my real core goal‚Äî"writing"‚Äîalso stagnated.
It was then that I realized that a tool is ultimately just an aid. If you miss the sailing season because you were busy building the perfect ship, the ship itself loses its meaning. AI has indeed increased my writing efficiency tenfold, but if I keep getting bogged down in tool development, I'll never be able to enjoy this benefit.
So, I've decided to change my strategy: simultaneous progress, iterative optimization.
Whatever output I have, I'll put it out there first. Even if it's just a half-finished product, some scattered thoughts, it still represents a forward trajectory.
„Äê New Series: Fragments of Thought | Creation Log ‚ú® „Äë
Therefore, to maintain discipline and faithfully record this process, I've decided to start a new content series that combines the random thoughts of #FragmentsofThought with the records of #CreationLog.
In the future, this series will be dedicated to placing my immature, more scattered, but very much want-to-share-in-real-time ideas and development progress. It won't be the final product, but it will be my most authentic thought process.
I look forward to interacting with everyone in this series. I'd also like to hear how you find a balance in this war between tools and content. Feel free to share your experiences in the comments!
