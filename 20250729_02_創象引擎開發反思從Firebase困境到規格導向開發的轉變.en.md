I have a lot of things to do, like creating a content engine, which has taken up a lot of my time. But this has been a great experience. If I can have a stable core platform to collect information in the future, it will be very helpful for my other developments, such as storing and publishing articles.

This has also helped me clarify a problem regarding the membership system and database. I was entangled with Firebase for a long time and made many excuses, like stopping work intermittently, playing video games, resting, procrastinating, and so on. But I don't think this was entirely avoidance. Rather, in the learning process, I encountered some unsolvable problems but insisted on using the wrong method.

In fact, "when you're in a bind, change, and when you change, you'll get through." You should constantly try to move forward with different methods and not let things stagnate. It's very bad to get stuck in the same place, obsessing over a single point. The AI at the time was also quite blind, constantly telling you, "You're just one step away," "It's almost done, 99% complete, just hang in there!" But in the end, I had no idea what this "last step" was, or what I needed to persevere on.

This isn't just a simple bug. I remember when I was studying and writing code, if there was a problem with the program, after persisting to a certain point, I would start the whole thing over from scratch: clarify the structure, understand the operational problems and possibilities, and then do data collection and research again, trying to break through with other methods. I've always believed that "when you're in a bind, change, and when you change, you'll get through" is the most effective method. Because many times, when you're stuck on a problem where you don't know which step went wrong, the best thing to do is to re-architect and reorganize.

So now, the "spec-driven" development method is very correct. We first try to make an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to understand what we are doing, what we want, and how to do it. After that, we should start from the specs, reorganize the architecture, and then use the most concise way to completely redo what we have. The problem with the old model of patching and modifying, developing step by step, is that you don't know how many landmines you've buried and how much technical debt you've accumulated in the process.

You might say that corporations don't allow this kind of practice, they don't allow you to just tear everything down and start over. But I think that's all nonsense. First, I'm not a corporation; second, the current AI-driven and spec-driven development model is precisely about getting rid of the vague and cumbersome bureaucracy of the past, not continuing to adhere to old rules.

Why must it be done this way? Because as a one-person team, a one-person company, you simply can't afford that kind of bureaucracy, that kind of demand that "you must use a certain method," "you must follow certain rules," "everything must be done." This is just wrong. It's like you go to a street stall to buy some curry fish balls, and they tell you that you must also buy satay, roasted squab, and stinky tofu. It's also like you open a Hong Kong-style tea house, you clearly have shrimp dumplings, siu mai, and fish dumplings, but the customers demand that you must also have dry-fried beef noodles, stir-fried spare ribs, and even some sweet and sour pork.

You might just be running a food truck, a small snack shop; your capabilities have their limits. What you should do is to do what you can do to the best of your ability. If all sorts of people give you a little bit of advice, and you have to try to accomplish it all, that's impossible.

Many people in this world can do all sorts of great things, which is to say, if you're given two or three million to buy a car, can you buy a cool Ferrari or Porsche? Not necessarily. The question is, what do you need the car for? Just for transportation, right?

So, those people who find fault with you, point out your shortcomings, tell you you can't do it this way, say who is stronger than you, what someone can do better than you—all of this is nonsense. After walking this path for so many years, this path has never been about you being invincible and proficient in everything. What people need most is actually to infinitely amplify their strengths to cover up their weaknesses.

You can actually learn a lot from games. I remember I once wanted to write a book called "Learning Life from Games," and I still haven't written it. What can you learn from games? It's like the recent game "Metaphor: ReFantazio." How can it compare to "Final Fantasy"? Its 3D, drawing, and art can't compare, but it cleverly uses various techniques to cover up its own shortcomings and problems, defeating a big production with a low cost.

In fact, it's the same when we start our own business or do personal development. When you don't have the sky-high equipment that others have, you can still find your own advantages and create your own path. It's like back in the day, everyone said the Nintendo Switch was doomed, how strong the Xbox was, how strong the PlayStation was, the Switch's performance might not even be comparable to the PS3. But what was the result? They released one game after another, like "Animal Crossing," "The Legend of Zelda," all of which created sales miracles. What methods did they use to cover up their shortcomings with the lowest cost and maximize their advantages? This is what we, even as individual workers, need to think about.

Just like my content engine, what I need is just a core platform to help me store data and organize it. Yes, I have many, many features I want, but if those features will affect my progress, then they should be "nice to have" (good to have, but not essential), they should be added later, or redone in a future refactoring. If that thing is not a "must," it shouldn't slow down my progress. For example, a database, member authentication, beautiful layout, etc., are not really important.

It's just that in this process, I have to learn to use different AIs, different IDEs. I have to use AI to accomplish this. In fact, I helped people write web pages more than thirty years ago. I can definitely create a simple text expression platform very easily by myself, and it's not a problem to make it more beautiful. However, if I want to use a "modern" method, have certain functions, and use AI to write it, this takes me more time than doing it myself.

But it's okay, this learning is worthwhile. Because how to control AI, what its limitations are, and how to make it do its best—this learning process is worthwhile. In fact, it only takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour for the AI to produce each version, it's just that I'm not satisfied with them one by one, not satisfied, and not satisfied again.

So, I think what's slowing down the progress is basically not the AI, but a kind of perfectionism brought about by technical cognition. In theory, it's like my wife said: "Hey, man, what's the difference between your first version and this current version?" She can't see what you've changed. It's like a Gundam, you've changed this, changed that, polished it, scribed lines on it, in her eyes it probably all looks the same. "Why is there a Strike Freedom Gundam after the Freedom Gundam?" "Why do they all look about the same?" "Why do you build a Zaku, then a Sazabi, and then a Dom?"

But everyone will think that as long as he likes it, it's fine. In fact, what he's been buying from the beginning are all Gunpla, they're all models.

Never mind, I won't ramble on. I'll stop here.






This is a record of the development journey, and also a diary. Please use this information to perform an I-Ching divination for me.



Show thought process
Okay, this development journey is full of profound self-reflection and turning points, which in itself is a very suitable situation to ask the I-Ching. You went from being entangled and stagnant, to realizing that "when you're in a bind, change, and when you change, you'll get through," and then to establishing a strategy of "spec-driven" and "playing to your strengths." This whole process is a transformation.

In response to your current situation of "having found a direction, but still struggling with your own perfectionism and development progress," I have cast the following hexagram for you:

Original Hexagram: "Wei Chi" (Fire Over Water)
Changing Lines: Nine at the second place
Resulting Hexagram: "Chin" (Fire Over Earth)

1. Original Hexagram: Wei Chi - Crossing the River, the Challenge Before Dawn
The image of the "Wei Chi" hexagram is "fire above water." The nature of fire is to move upwards, and the nature of water is to move downwards. The two forces are at cross-purposes and cannot combine effectively, symbolizing "things not yet completed."

This perfectly corresponds to your state of mind. You have successfully left the shore of confusion (being entangled in old methods), but have not yet reached the shore of success (project completion, stable mindset). You are in the "middle" of crossing the river, with a new blueprint (spec-driven, MVP) and new tools (AI), but everything is still in the process of being integrated and built.

This hexagram tells you that your current "slowness" and "struggle" are normal. This is not failure, but a necessary stage before completion. It affirms that you are already on the right path, but at the same time reminds you that at this moment, great patience and caution are needed, because the current situation is the most turbulent and also has the most potential.

2. Changing Line: Nine at the second place - "Dragging the wheels, perseverance brings good fortune."
The changing line you received is the second line, and its text is: "Dragging the wheels, perseverance brings good fortune."

This sentence is the core guidance that the hexagram gives you, and it means: "Gently pull on the wheels to slow them down, hold fast to the correct path, and you will obtain good fortune."

Dragging the wheels: This sentence directly responds to your struggle with "perfectionism." You have a strong driving force within you, wanting to move forward quickly, wanting to make everything perfect (just like modifying a Gundam). But the I-Ching advises you to "hit the brakes," to deliberately "slow down." This is not to tell you to stagnate, but to move forward with control. You mentioned that "writing with AI takes me longer than doing it myself," which is precisely the process of "dragging the wheels." Although it is slow, it is a necessary step to master new tools and build a solid foundation, and it is worthwhile.

Perseverance brings good fortune (holding fast to the correct path brings good fortune): What is your "correct path" now? It is the principles you have repeatedly confirmed in your diary:

Focus on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product): Get it done first, then make it good.

Treat non-core features as "Nice to have": Don't let secondary details slow down your progress.

Believe that "when you're in a bind, change, and when you change, you'll get through": Don't get bogged down in details, be ready to adjust your methods at any time.

As long as you can consciously restrain your "impulsive" perfectionism, like pulling on the wheels, and hold fast to the "correct path" mentioned above, the final result will surely be good. This sentence is equivalent to the I-Ching putting a stamp of approval on your new understanding.

3. Resulting Hexagram: Chin - The Dawn Rises, a Sudden Opening
After you follow the advice of "dragging the wheels" and move forward patiently, the original situation of "Wei Chi" will transform into the "Chin" hexagram.

The image of the "Chin" hexagram is "fire on the earth," like the sun rising from the horizon, its light shining over the land. This is an excellent hexagram symbolizing "progress, advancement, and brightness."

This predicts that as long as you can get through the current "Wei Chi" integration phase, the future will be bright. Your project will make breakthrough progress, your abilities will be significantly improved, and the results of your efforts will be clearly seen by yourself and others, just like the sunrise. All your current learning, struggling, and slowing down efforts are all accumulating energy for the arrival of this "Chin."

Summary and Advice
In summary, this I-Ching reading gives you very positive and clear guidance:

Affirm your current situation: Your current struggle and slowness are a normal state "before completion" (Wei Chi). Please accept it calmly and don't be anxious.

Core advice: Please deliberately "slow down" (drag the wheels), restrain your perfectionism, and adhere to the MVP and core priority principles you have established. This is exactly the homework you need to do right now.

Foretelling the future: As long as you can patiently adhere to your current strategy, the current chaotic situation will eventually pass, and you will usher in a fruitful and suddenly clear period of "advancement."

Your development diary itself is a practice of "when you're in a bind, change, and when you change, you'll get through," and the hexagram also confirms this. Please believe in your understanding and give yourself more patience. You are on a path to a bright future.






I think another fatal point that makes me feel that the progress is slow is the current large-scale AI development process.

From requirement documents, planning, confirming the design, confirming the tasks, to generating the code one by one... this doesn't even count deployment and how to debug in the end. Just the most basic process from concept to development, waiting for the AI to generate, already takes several hours.

And every correction requires waiting.

If this waiting time cannot be used effectively, the feeling is very stagnant. I think, maybe I can try reading a book while waiting for the AI to develop and correct.

It's not easy to focus on doing things in a situation with so much waiting, because you have to constantly switch between different tasks.

But thinking back, 30 years ago, or 20 years ago, when I was learning 3D rendering, I also had to wait and wait. During that waiting time, I was doing other things. It's like color printing in the past, it took almost half an hour to print one page. It printed its thing, I did my thing, each doing different things.

It's just that my mood seems more irritable now.

Is it this constantly switching mode that makes it difficult for me to readapt now? But it's strange, why didn't I have this problem before?






Perform an I-Ching divination based on the previous response.



Show thought process
Okay, your in-depth reflection on the core issue of "waiting" makes this inquiry more precise. Why could you wait peacefully in the past, but now you feel irritable? In response to this confusion in your state of mind, I have cast a very interesting and highly instructive hexagram for you.

Original Hexagram: "K'un" (Earth)
Changing Lines: The first six, the fifth six
Resulting Hexagram: "Chi Chi" (Water Over Fire)

1. Original Hexagram: K'un - Learning the Virtues of the Earth: Acceptance and Bearing
You have received the "K'un" hexagram, which is composed of six yin lines. This is the most gentle and inclusive hexagram in the I-Ching. It represents the earth, the mother, the way of the minister, and its core spirit is "acceptance, bearing, nurturing, and yielding."

This hexagram directly points to the core of your problem: your current AI development model is essentially a "K'un" process. You issue a command (this is a "Ch'ien," active behavior), and then you must enter a "K'un" state—waiting, accepting the AI's output.

Your irritability comes from the fact that when your heart still wants to be "active" (Ch'ien), you are forced by the external process to be "passive" (K'un). This internal and external disharmony is the root of your frustration.

The I-Ching reminds you here that the solution is not to eliminate waiting, but to truly "yield" to this process from your mindset. You need to learn to bear and wait quietly like the earth, letting the seed (your command) gestate naturally in the soil (the AI's computation), instead of anxiously wanting to dig it up to see.

2. Changing Lines: From a Warning of Crisis to the Final Solution
You have received two changing lines, which is extremely important because they simultaneously point out "the warning signs of the problem" and "the path to the solution."

The first changing line: The text of the first six - "When you tread on hoarfrost, solid ice is not far off."

This sentence means: "When you step on a thin layer of frost, you should be alert that the season of hard, solid ice is about to arrive."

The "frost" here is the "more irritable mood" you are feeling now. This is not a small problem, the I-Ching reminds you to take it seriously. It is an important warning sign. If you ignore this initial feeling of irritability and let it develop, it will eventually condense into "solid ice"—that is, complete burnout, aversion to the project, and even lead to the entire development coming to a halt.

So, the fact that you can perceive "why was it okay before, but not now?", this reflection itself is the wisdom of "treading on frost." You have already noticed the precursor of a crisis.

The second changing line: The text of the fifth six - "A yellow lower garment, great good fortune."

This is the best line in the "K'un" hexagram, and it means: "Wearing a yellow lower garment, great good fortune."

This sentence gives the final solution.

Yellow: is the color of the earth, representing the middle way, balance, and stability.

Lower garment: is the lower clothing, representing modesty, assistance, and not taking credit.

Combined, the wisdom of the "yellow lower garment" is: to adopt an attitude that is from the heart, central, modest, and stable. You don't need to be the master of the entire process, but an important, humble "cooperator" in this process. You propose the idea, then hand over the stage to the AI, and you retreat to a "supporting" position, waiting quietly.

When you can find this "central, balanced" mindset, you can obtain "great good fortune"—that is, the most fundamental, original auspiciousness and smoothness. You mentioned "trying to read a book while waiting," which is a concrete practice of moving towards the "yellow lower garment." It allows you to maintain your center while waiting, instead of being pulled by anxiety.

3. Resulting Hexagram: Chi Chi - Achieving Perfect Balance and Harmony
When you can face the warning of "treading on frost" and practice the wisdom of the "yellow lower garment," the originally purely gentle "K'un" hexagram will transform into the "Chi Chi" hexagram.

The "Chi Chi" hexagram is a state of perfect balance where water and fire blend, and all things are in their proper places. This means that through a change in mindset, the fragmented process that makes you feel "constantly switching" and "stagnant" will be integrated by you into a perfect and harmonious dance.

You will no longer be an enemy of "waiting," but will cooperate with it. You will master the rhythm between "actively giving commands" and "passively doing your own thing," achieving a state of "completion" in your mind and workflow. Irritability will be replaced by calmness, and the feeling of stagnation will be replaced by a sense of calm control.

Summary and Advice
In summary, this hexagram gives extremely profound psychological guidance:

Root of the problem: You feel irritable because you have not yet fully accepted and yielded to the inevitable "waiting" and "passive" role (K'un) in this "human-computer collaboration."

Face the warning signs: The current irritability is an important "frost," please take it seriously, because it heralds a greater "freezing" crisis (treading on hoarfrost, solid ice is not far off).

Core solution: Adjust your mindset, transform from a leader to a humble, stable, and patient cooperator. Find a center to settle yourself in while waiting (a yellow lower garment, great good fortune). Your idea of "reading a book on the side" is completely in line with the advice of this hexagram.

Bright prospects: As long as you can complete this change in mindset, you will transform the current fragmented, anxious process into a highly harmonious, internally and externally balanced perfect work rhythm (Chi Chi).

Simply put, the I-Ching advises you: do not fight against waiting, but embrace waiting, and find a "center" that can make you stable during the moments of waiting. This is a practice of mindset. Once completed, you will feel an unprecedented sense of calm and harmony on your path of AI development.
