# My AI Survival Reflections: From Creative Soul to an Inevitable Cultural War

> This dialogue began with what I initially considered a rather simple observation. I read an article that vividly depicted how economic cycles affect our consumption behavior—during good times, people pursue top-tier restaurants and luxury goods; during downturns, high "cost-effectiveness" chain brands rise; when survival becomes an issue, cheap and usable Taobao goods become king, and even convenience stores must start using "pre-made meals" to control costs.

The article's conclusion was: Winners always understand **"adapt to poverty, change leads to success."**

I thought at the time, isn't this just like the situation creators face with AI? We seemingly only need to view AI as a new "era change," adapt to it, utilize it, and we can find new ways forward. However, I quickly realized that my initial thought was far too optimistic and naive.

## First Layer of Thinking: From "Survival of the Fittest" to Awakening to "Ecological Catastrophe"

My initial thought was that AI is like an auxiliary tool, with the key being whether we can inject our own **"soul"** into the process of using it. But this idea was quickly overturned by a more brutal reality, which was also the first crucial turning point in my thinking.

I realized that what we're facing is fundamentally not a new tool that needs "adaptation," but an AI-driven **"information pollution."**

The fact I observed is: someone is using pure AI to produce millions of words daily and publish dozens of novels. This isn't creation—this is a **"flood monster"** designed to cater to algorithms and drown search results with garbage quantity. Their appearance isn't to enrich the creative ecosystem, but to pollute the water source and plunder traffic at near-zero cost, leaving those who truly create with heart without even a chance to be seen.

This made me understand that simply discussing "adapting to change" is meaningless. When change itself is an **"ecological catastrophe,"** our first priority isn't adaptation, but thinking about how not to be devoured by this catastrophe.

## Second Layer of Thinking: Having "Soul," but "How to Be Seen"?

Facing this content flood, my initial instinctive response was that we must return to the core of creation—what I previously called the "soul."

I remembered those works that truly moved me, like Yoshihiro Togashi's **"Hunter x Hunter," where the emotional struggles and growth of characters are so profound; and "Dragon Ball," "Slam Dunk,"** their portrayal of human brilliance and fragility, that unique vitality that AI could never replicate through data imitation. I believed this was the most powerful weapon of human creators.

But then, a more despairing question emerged, which was the second layer of my deep thinking: In a room full of noise, no matter how beautiful your singing voice, who can hear it?

No matter how much soul my work contains, how much real life experience, when it's buried by millions of AI garbage articles pushed by algorithms, what's the meaning of its existence? My thinking focus painfully shifted from "how to write good works" to the more brutal survival question of **"how to make good works seen."** This was no longer a philosophical question, but a real dilemma about livelihood and whether one's efforts could be respected.

## Third Layer of Thinking: This Isn't Just Creation, but a "Cultural Defense War"

Just when I felt helpless about this, I connected it to a grander issue in Taiwanese society in recent years, which finally allowed me to see the full picture and brought the ultimate upgrade to my thinking.

I remembered the warnings raised by former Digital Development Minister Audrey Tang, and the **"cognitive warfare"** threats that Taiwanese society continues to face. I was shocked to realize that those daily thousands, even millions of AI garbage content pieces—they're not just garbage; often, they're "weapons."

Their purpose isn't just to earn traffic, but to conduct organized, purposeful **"cultural invasion."** Through seemingly harmless novels, articles, and news, they subtly implant specific ideologies, dilute local culture, create social division, and undermine our sense of trust. This is fundamentally different from simple commercial competition.

When I understood this layer, I finally grasped the true meaning of "fighting AI with AI." This is a war whose scale and speed far exceed human capacity. We face machine-level attacks and naturally need machine-level defense.

I also finally saw clearly that we creators struggling to survive in the digital age have unknowingly already stood on the front lines of a **"cultural defense war."**

## My Conclusion: As Creators, We Stand on the Defense Line Protecting Meaning

Starting from an economic trend metaphor, my thoughts have traveled a long path. I now believe that creation in the AI era is itself a form of **"defense."**

What we defend isn't just our own livelihood, but society's **"information sovereignty" and "cultural foundation."** Every piece that insists on originality and contains real emotions, every time we choose to support and share soulful creations, we're fighting against that torrent trying to drown everything with endless emptiness.

We stand on a defense line protecting "meaning"—this is a collective battle none of us can avoid.
